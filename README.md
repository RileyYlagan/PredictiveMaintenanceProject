Project Description:
--------------------

Predictive maintenance is a technique that uses machine learning and
data science tools in order to detect issues within an operation’s
machine or equipment so that maintenance can be done prior to machine
failure. The strategy of predictive maintenance aims to allow for
maintenance to be conveniently scheduled and prevent unexpected failure
of equipment. This process reduces costs as maintenance is done only
when needed.

This project uses a synthetics, yet realistic dataset that details a
machine’s process parameters, whether a machine failed, and if so, how
it failed. The goals of this project are:  
- To be able to predict whether a machine failure occurs or not given
the machine’s process conditions  
- If a machine fails, classify further which failure mode caused the
machine to fail

Dataset Information
-------------------

The dataset used is a “synthetic dataset that reflects real predictive
maintenance encountered in industry”<sup>1</sup>. It consists of 10,000
data points stored as rows with 14 features in columns. Each row
represents a single process ran on a machine. The first 3 variables show
the process identifiers, the next 5 varaibles are process parameters,
and the last 6 variables represent the failure label and failure types.
